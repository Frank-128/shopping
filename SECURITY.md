## Reporting a Vulnerability

I appreciate your help in keeping my project secure. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by following these guidelines:

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

**Reporting Channel:** Email me at **muddyfakih98@gmail.com**  
**Expected Response Timeline:** I aim to acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within 3 business days and provide an update on the status of the investigation within 7 business days.  
**Vulnerability Assessment Process:** I will assess reported vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and potential impact.  
**Confidentiality:** I will treat all reported vulnerabilities confidentially until a fix is publicly released.  
**Coordinator Contact:** For any questions regarding the vulnerability reporting process, please contact me security coordinator, Muddy, at **muddyfakih98@gmail.com**.
